# BookCutter - Keyboard Shortcuts for your favorite links

This is a browser extension for chrome.

## Install

- Within chrome, type "chrome://extensions" in the address bar and activate developer mode on the top right (switch).
- Click on the "Load unpacked" button that appeared and select the folder containing "background.js" and the "manifest.json" files.

## Customize
Open the "background.js" file. There are 2 example webpages, which you can replace. You can add your own links into the bookmarks object. The accessor is the letter you want to assign and the value of course the link you want to reach by the assigned letter.

## Usage

CTRL + ALT + G would open up google, in my example. CTRL + ALT + W would open Wikipedia.
